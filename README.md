> Do something useful with your Kindle notes :) This script extracts individual words from `My Clippings` file hidden on your Kindle e-reader, translates them using Google Translate and exports the pair "original word" ‚Üí "translation" into a `.txt` file from which you can learn these words or import them into an application such as [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/).

Script skips sentences, numbers, special characters, etc. ‚Äî only single words are being translated. Words in desired language are skipped.

## How to use

### Speed things up ‚ö°
`deep-translator` works very slowly with Google Translate so we need to do a little tweak first. Install the package and go to the location where `deep-translator` is installed:
```sh
pip install deep-translator
pip show deep-translator
```
Open `google_trans.py` & go to line 177. Edit:
```py
# sleep(2) # => ~ 33.33 mins to translate 1000 words
sleep(0.1) # => ~ 1.66 mins to translate 1000 words
```
Save.

### Windows
1. Connect your Kindle via USB cable to your computer.
2. Download `script.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/vardecab/kindle-words/releases).
3. Go to the download location, unzip & run `script.exe`. 
4. Write source & target languages or wait if defaults (`en` & `pl`) are ok.
5. Write drive letter associated with Kindle or wait if default (`D`) is ok.
6. Wait a few minutes - words are being translated.
7. Go to `script\output\kindle-words_export.txt` to check exported file.
8. (optional) Add it to [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/).
9. Voil√† ‚ú®

### macOS
1. Connect your Kindle via USB cable to your Mac.
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Open Terminal/iTerm and install necessary packages (use `pip` or `pip3`):
```py
pip install inputimeout
pip install deep-translator 
pip install pync
pip install langdetect
```
3. Navigate to the folder you cloned/downloaded & run the script:
```sh
cd '/Users/USER/Downloads/kindle-words'
python script.py
``` 
4. Write source & target languages or wait if defaults (`en` & `pl`) are ok.
5. Write your Kindle's name or wait if default (`Kindle`) is ok.
6. Wait a few minutes - words are being translated.
7. Go to `output/kindle-words_export.txt` to check exported file.
8. (optional) Add it to [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/).

## Roadmap
 
- üéØ Dictionary definitions. (Need a different API)
- ‚úÖ <del>Improve regex formula to better deal with words that have special characters.</del>
- ‚úÖ <del>Extract single words from source file.</del>
- ‚úÖ <del>Output list line by line.</del> 
- ‚úÖ <del>Use API to translate words.</del>
- ‚úÖ <del>Skip the same words on subsequent imports.</del>
- ‚ùå <del>Use DeepL rather than Google Translate.</del> (Requires paid subscription)

## Release History

- 1.6: Added backup functionality to save `My Clippings` file locally
- 1.5.2: Added one more rule to clean the data.
- 1.5.1: Fixed Windows 10 notifications bug.
- 1.5: Added language detection to skip translation of words already in desired language.
- 1.4: Added notifications for macOS & Windows.
- 1.3: Added support for macOS.
- 1.2.1: Added `try/except` to fix a `FileNotFoundError` error.
- 1.2: Fixed `io.open` bug; added some `try/except` to catch more errors; re-enabled `timeout_time`; added `last_word` export so it's easy to see which words are new and which are old. Published in [Releases](https://github.com/vardecab/kindle-words/releases).
- 1.1: Quite a big re-write: it now works properly with `My Clippings.txt` file from Kindle - all bugs are fixed. Initial run takes ~ 10 minutes to complete (depending on the size of your file) but afterwards it's usually < 1 minute because data from previous run is stored locally for comparison - only new words are being translated to save time and improve speed.
- 1.0.0: Using new backend - [deep-translator](https://github.com/nidhaloff/deep-translator). 
- 0.12.5: Bug in the API discovered.
- 0.12.4: Cleared up the code for better readability.
- 0.12.3: Fixes to `regex` formula so it also takes words with `,` & `‚Äî`.
- 0.12.2: Print which folder was created for exported files.
- 0.12.1: Renamed variables & export files' names to improve readability. 
- 0.12: Be able to select source & target languages.
- 0.11: Added input timeout.
- 0.10: Take input file directly from Kindle once drive letter is given.
- 0.9: Export files to specific folders based on today's date & ID. 
- 0.8: Add script runtime info.
- 0.7: Fixes to `regex` formula so it also takes words with `.`, `-` & `"`.
- 0.6: Print translations directly to `kindle-words_export-{DATE}.txt`.   
- 0.5: No more duplicate words.
- 0.4: Fixed `charmap' codec can't encode character (...)` problem that occured with PL characters. 
- 0.3: Translation with [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans) lib.
-   0.2: Output list line by line + export to a `.txt.` file. 
-   0.1: Initial release. Extract single words from source file using `regex`.
